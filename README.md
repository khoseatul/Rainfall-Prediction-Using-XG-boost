#Model for Next-Day Prediction
Data Source
The data used in this project was downloaded from the Kaggle dataset titled Rain in Australia, which itself was originally sourced from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology's Daily Weather Observations. Additional weather metrics for Australia can be found within the bureau's Climate Data Online web app.

Business Problem
Weather, and humankind's ability to accurately predict it, plays a critical role in many aspects of life. From farmers growing crops to a family planning a weekend vacation to logistical decision making within airlines, rain in particular is highly influential regarding plans. In some instances, the impact of rain can have large financial consequences. As a result, there is a strong interest from a plethora of stakeholders in the ability to accurately forecast rain. The goal of this project is to use the available data to create a next-day prediction model for whether or not it will rain. Such a model could be utilized in a weather app for the benefit of the public at large.
